## 🔍 Overview
 
This project implements a full end-to-end **Optical Character Recognition (OCR)** system trained specifically to recognize **handwritten characters**. From raw pen strokes to structured, machine-readable text — this pipeline handles everything: image preprocessing, feature extraction, deep learning–based classification, and a production-ready REST API for real-time inference.
 
Whether you're digitizing handwritten notes, building assistive tools for accessibility, automating form processing, or just fascinated by the intersection of computer vision and machine learning — this repo has everything you need to get up and running.

## 📓 Notebooks Walkthrough
 
The `notebooks/` folder is a complete, self-contained training environment. Run them in order:
 
| # | Notebook | What it does |
|---|----------|-------------|
| 01 | `01_Data_Manger.ipynb` | Loads the dataset, visualizes class distribution, inspects sample images |
| 02 | `02_EDA&Visualization.ipynb` | Applies grayscale conversion, noise removal, binarization, resizing, and augmentation |
| 03 | `03_Augmentation.ipynb` | Defines CNN architecture, trains the model, saves weights to `models/` |
| 04 | `04_CNN_Model.ipynb` | CNN built from scratch and evaluated, plots confusion matrix and accuracy curves |
| 04 | `05_TransferLearning.ipynb` | Transfer Learning via Mobilenetv2 and evaluation |
 
```bash
# Launch Jupyter
jupyter notebook notebooks/
```

## 🧠 Model Architecture in API
 
The recognition pipeline consists of five stages:
 
```
Raw Image
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│   1. Preprocessing  │  Grayscale → Denoise → Binarize → Resize → Normalize
└─────────────────────┘
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│  2. Segmentation    │  Isolate individual characters from the input
└─────────────────────┘
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│ 3. Feature Extract  │  CNN layers — convolutional + pooling → spatial features
└─────────────────────┘
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│ 4. Classification   │  Fully connected layers → softmax over character classes
└─────────────────────┘
    │
    ▼
┌─────────────────────┐
│ 5. Postprocessing   │  Top-1 prediction + confidence score returned via API
└─────────────────────┘
```

Detailed plots and per-class breakdowns are in the `visuals/` folder:
 
- **`training_curves.png`** — accuracy and loss across epochs
- **`confusion_matrix.png`** — which characters get confused with which
- **`sample_predictions.png`** — input images alongside model predictions

## 📡 API Reference
 
### `POST /predict`
 
Accepts a handwritten character image and returns the predicted character with a confidence score.
 
**Request**
 
| Parameter | Type | Required | Description |
|-----------|------|----------|-------------|
| `image` | `file` | ✅ | PNG or JPEG image of a handwritten character |
 
**Response**
 
```json
{
  "prediction": "A",
  "confidence": 0.97
}
```
 
**Error Response**
 
```json
{
  "error": "No image provided"
}
```
 
**Example using Python `requests`:**
 
```python
import requests
 
url = "http://localhost:5000/predict"
with open("test_pictures/sample_A.png", "rb") as f:
    response = requests.post(url, files={"image": f})
 
print(response.json())
# → {"prediction": "A", "confidence": 0.97}
```
